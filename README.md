# Helios Language Server (Helios-LS) [![CI][badge]][ci]

The Helios Language Server is an intermediary between an editor or IDE and the
Helios compiler. It implements the [Language Server Protocol][language-server-protocol],
which allows us to provide Helios with common editor functionality such as
autocomplete, go-to definitions and find-all-references in one centralised
location.

This project is still in its early stages of development. So far, only a limited
functionality is provided. You may see the progress of the project under the
[Progress](#Progress) section.

## Building and testing

Building and testing is as easy as the following:

```shell
$ cargo build # building
$ cargo test # testing
```

## Usage

Once this crate has been built, the executable produced will be called
`helios-ls`. For now, the server can only be communicated via standard input and
output (`stdin` and `stdout`).

You should not need to invoke this executable manually â€“ that is what clients
are for. At the moment, there is only one client implementation available:
[Helios for Visual Studio Code][vscode-helios-github]). This client (essentially
a VS Code language extension) will handle the communication between it and this
language server for you as well as provide editor-specific features previously
mentioned.
